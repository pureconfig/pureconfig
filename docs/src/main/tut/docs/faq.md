### How can I use PureConfig with Spark 2.1.0 (problematic shapeless dependency)?

Apache Spark (specifically version 2.1.0) has a transitive dependency
on [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless) 2.0.0. This version is
too old to be used by PureConfig, making your Spark project fail when using
`spark-submit`. The solution is to shade, i.e. rename, the version of shapeless
used by PureConfig.

#### SBT

If you are using the [sbt-assembly](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly) plugin
to create your JARs you
can [shade](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly#shading) shapeless by
adding to your `assembly.sbt` file the following setting:

```scala
assemblyShadeRules in assembly := Seq(ShadeRule.rename("shapeless.**" -> "new_shapeless.@1").inAll)
```

#### Maven

The [maven-shade-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/)
can shade shapeless by adding to your `pom.xml` file the following block:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>shade</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <createDependencyReducedPom>false</createDependencyReducedPom>
        <relocations>
            <relocation>
                <pattern>shapeless</pattern>
                <shadedPattern>shapelesspureconfig</shadedPattern>
            </relocation>
        </relocations>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

### How can I avoid displaying sensitive parts of my configuration, such as passwords, when I print the result of PureConfig?

Configuration commonly includes sensitive information, such as passwords or keys. Generally these values should not appear in logging.

Unfortunately this means that Scala's typically helpful behavior of generating transparent `toString` methods gets in the way. When a configuration is loaded into a `case class`, then the default `toString` generated by Scala will display sensitive information. This behavior is standard Scala and has nothing to do with PureConfig per se.

A solution we've seen address this concern is to wrap the sensitive field in an [`AnyVal` new type](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/value-classes.html) which simply redefines `toString`. Please see the example below:

```tut:silent
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory
import pureconfig._

case class Sensitive(value: String) extends AnyVal {
  override def toString: String = "MASKED"
}

case class SuperSecretConfig(
  username: String,
  password: Sensitive,
  apiKey: Sensitive)
```

Then when we print out the `SuperSecretConfig` after loading it via PureConfig, the sensitive values are masked:

```tut:book
val secret = loadConfigOrThrow[SuperSecretConfig](ConfigFactory.parseString("""{
  username: john.smith
  password: password123
  api-key: 8ef72f48-2143-48af-9573-3b519bbcb777
}"""))
```

But, of course, the values we need are still there:

```tut:book
secret.password.value 
secret.apiKey.value
``` 

### How do I debug "implicit not found" errors?

When we want to load a config with a large structure and Scala refuses to compile a reader for it, it can be difficult
to understand the reason of the failure. Consider the following example:

```tut:silent:reset
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory
import pureconfig._

class Custom(x: Int, s: String) // not a case class
class Custom2(x: Int, s: String) // not a case class

sealed trait Conf
case class ConfA(a: Boolean, b: Option[Boolean]) extends Conf
sealed trait ConfB extends Conf
case class ConfB1(a: Int) extends ConfB
case class ConfB2(a: String) extends ConfB
case class ConfC(a: Option[Custom], b: Custom2) extends Conf
```

When we try to load a `Conf` from a config, we'll simply get this error message:

```tut:book:fail
loadConfig[Conf]
```

In PureConfig, the derivation of config readers and writers is done by chaining implicits - the converters of larger
structures (like `Conf`) depend on the implicit converters of smaller ones (like `Boolean` or `Custom`). However, Scala
is not helpful in case one of those upstream dependencies is missing, limiting itself to showing the message above.

Since version 0.8.0, PureConfig provides a way to obtain better error messages for those cases. To enable it, we need to
add the following entry to our SBT project:

```scala
scalacOptions += "-Xmacro-settings:materialize-derivations"
```

When code using PureConfig derived converters is compiled using the compiler flag above, an internal macro will analyze
the dependencies between converters and show a much more helpful message in case of an error:

```scala
loadConfig[Conf]
// <console>:18: error: could not derive a ConfigReader instance for type Conf, because:
//   - missing a ConfigReader instance for type ConfC, because:
//     - missing a ConfigReader instance for type Option[Custom], because:
//       - missing a ConfigReader instance for type Custom
//     - missing a ConfigReader instance for type Custom2
// 
//        loadConfig[Conf]
//  
```

Since this is an experimental feature, it may not work as intended in some unforesseen cases. If you find any issue with
it, please do open an issue!
